        <h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
        <P>
            I transitioned into the tech field through an intensive 15-week software engineering bootcamp.
            As a data analyst, I developed further experience with SQL, <br> problem-solving, and attention to             
            detail, and continued enhancing my software engineering skills through online tutoring and
            courses. I am now seeking an entry level <br> software engineering position where I can apply my
            technical skills for professional growth.
