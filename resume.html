            I transitioned into the tech field through an intensive 15-week software engineering bootcamp. <br>
            As a data analyst, I developed further experience with SQL, problem-solving, and attention to <br>           
            detail, and continued enhancing my software engineering skills through online tutoring and <br>
            courses. I am now seeking an entry level software engineering position where I can apply my <br>
            technical skills for professional growth.
